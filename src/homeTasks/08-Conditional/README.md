**Conditionally Rendering a React Router v4 Route with the Switch Component** - We often want to render a Route conditionally within our application. In React Router v4, the Route components match the current route inclusively so a “stack” of Routes will all be processed. To render a single Route exclusively we can wrap them in the Switch component to render the first Route that matches our current URL.
